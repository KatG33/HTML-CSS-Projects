Hey there! Welcome to my Beginner's CSS Projects repository! This is where I'm diving into the world of CSS and web development. 
I'm getting inspired by the awesome lessons and ideas from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

What's Inside?
I've put together a bunch of simple CSS projects here to help me learn the basics and beyond. Each project is all about styling, layout, and making things look cool on the web.

My Certification Journey.
I'm on a mission to earn my Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp. This repo tracks my progress and shows off what I've been learning as I level up my CSS skills.

Shoutout to freeCodeCamp!!
Big thanks to freeCodeCamp for their awesome tutorials and challenges that are helping me grow as a web developer!
