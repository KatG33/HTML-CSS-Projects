Hey there! Welcome to my Beginner's CSS Projects repository! This is where I'm diving into the world of CSS and web development. 
I'm getting inspired by the awesome lessons and ideas from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

What's Inside?
I've put together a bunch of simple CSS projects here to help me learn the basics and beyond. Each project is all about styling, layout, and making things look cool on the web.

My Certification Journey.
I'm on a mission to earn my Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp. This repo tracks my progress and shows off what I've been learning as I level up my CSS skills.

Shoutout to freeCodeCamp!!
Big thanks to freeCodeCamp for their awesome tutorials and challenges that are helping me grow as a web developer!

How to Run These Projects:
Each project in this repository includes one .html file, the webpage, and one .css file, the styling.
1. Download a project folder with both files
2. Double click the .html file, and it will automatically open the webpage with .css styling
OR
2. Load the .html and .css files to https://onecompiler.com/ and press 'RUN' in the top right corner
