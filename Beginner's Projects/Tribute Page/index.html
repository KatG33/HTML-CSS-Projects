          <h2>About Peanut</h2>
          <hr class="brown-line">
          <p>Peanut, also known as P'Nut, was an eastern gray squirrel rescued in 2017 by Mark Longo after his mother was tragically killed by a car in New York City. Over the next seven years, Peanut became a beloved companion and a social media sensation, captivating hundreds of thousands of followers with his charming antics and endearing personality.</p>
          <hr class="brown-line">
          <p>In October 2024, Peanut was seized by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation due to concerns about the legality of keeping wild animals as pets. Despite efforts to certify Peanut as an educational animal, he was euthanized on November 1, 2024, after allegedly biting someone during the investigation. This event sparked widespread public outcry and discussions about wildlife regulations and pet ownership rights.</p>
          <hr class="brown-line">
          <p>Peanut's legacy lives on through the joy he brought to his followers and the awareness he raised about animal rescue and care. He will be fondly remembered and deeply missed.</p>
